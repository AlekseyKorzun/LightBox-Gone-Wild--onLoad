When you would like to automaticly have a pop up simply add following line of HTML to your code 
(including prototype.js and lightbox.js provided):

<input class="lbOn" id="lbOnAuto" type="hidden" value="http://google.com">
            
(replace value="" with url you would like lightbox to display inside)
